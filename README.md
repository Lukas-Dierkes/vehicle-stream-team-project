## 1. General Info 
***
Within the team project of the University of Mannheim, 2 research projects of INES were presented:
- Mobile e-hub, which investigates how drones can use the rides of cars so that ordered packages can be delivered to customers by drones and cars
- HitchHikeBox, investigating how customer ordered packages can be delivered from boxes carried on other rides that are part of the environment
This project is about analyzing real world data of a startup (Mobility-on-Demand) to determine the feasibility of using existing mobility data to support Ines' projects.
